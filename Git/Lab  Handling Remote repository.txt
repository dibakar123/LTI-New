Lab  Handling Remote repository
-----------------------------
Step.1. Cloning a repository

The git clone command copies an existing Git repository. 
This copy is a working Git repository with the complete history of the cloned repository. 
It can be used completely isolated from the original repository.
# switch to a new directory
mkdir online
cd online

# clone online repository
git clone https://github.com/dibakar123/Java-Project1.git

If you clone a repository, Git implicitly creates a remote named "origin" by default. 

Step.2. Check Git Status

#Go to local repository folder 
cd Java-Project
git status

Step.3. Take actions in local copies
# do some changes
echo "I added a remote repo" > test02
mkdir test1
git status

Step.4. Make actions permanent
# send to staging
git add .
git status

# commit
git commit -a -m "This is a test for the new remote origin"
git status

#send to remote repository
git push origin

**************************************************************************************



List all of the branches in your repository. This is synonymous with :
git branch --list

To get list of all branches (local & remote)
git branch -a -v

To create a new branch, simply specify a name - and possibly a starting point
git branch <branch>

Delete the specified branch. This is a “safe” operation in that Git prevents from deleting the branch if it has unmerged changes.
git branch <branch> -d

Force delete the specified branch, even if it has unmerged changes. This is the command to use if you want to permanently throw away all of the commits associated with a particular line of development.
git branch -D <branch>

Rename the current branch to <branch>.
git branch <oldbranch> -m <newbranch>


To create a branch in local system:
-----------------------
	git branch bbb   [ here bbb is the branch name ]
now do some new jobs in project as :
	echo "aaaaaaa">aaaaaa.txt
	git checkout bbb   [ to move to branch-bbb from master ]
	git add .          [ adding new data to staging area for branch:bbb]
	git commit -m "add in branch bbb" [ to commit in branch bbb ]
now come out from branch-bbb
	git branch master


To add a new branch in remote repository:

	git remote add branch1 https://github.com/dibakar123/Java-Project1.git
# Add remote repo to local repo config
	git push branch1 bbb
# pushes the crazy-experiment branch to new-remote-repo
