What is JDBC
------
JDBC is an API  which is used to make communication with java & database.

How many types of JDBC Drivers ? 
1>JDBC ODBC DRIVER
2>NATIVE DRIVER
3>JDBC NETWORK PROTOCOL DRIVER
4>JDBC THIN DRIVER.


Steps for JDBC:
1>Load the driver using Class.forName(),DriverManager.registerDriver()
2>Create connection object
	Connection con=DriverManager.GetConnection("jdbc url","user id","Password");
3>Create SQL statement using Statement,PreparedStatement,CollableStatement
4>Execute sql statement using execute(),executeUpdate(),executeQuery().
5>Close connection.

Difference between Statement/PreparedStatement/CallableStatment 

Statement interface is used to execute normal sql query,Here we cant pass parameter at runtime.
PreparedStatement extends Statement interface with supports dynamic or parameterised sql query. Here we can pass parameter runtime.
It is more prefarable single query occures multiple times by varring its parameters.
CallablleStatement is used to execute store procedure present im database server. It support In,Out,InOut parameters.

Difference between  executeUpdate() / executeQuery() 

executeUpdate()				                executeQuery()
It is used to insert/update/delete                       It is used for select query
Its return int that indicates how many row effected      It retuns ResultSet


What is ResultSet ? 
Result is a cussor in jdbc which points to set of records.
We can move it by calling next() which return boolean.

Control a transaction from JDBC 
By default each transtaction in jdbc is autoCommited.
To control transcation programitically, need to : con.setAutoCommit(false).
Now programitically we call con.commit(),con.rollback() to save or undo transactions.
