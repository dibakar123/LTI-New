under github, make a new repository and check its url

Now open eclipse , go to git perspcetive,
click on "clone a git repository" and give the url , with userid/password for github account
now repository is created in local.

Now make a maven project as webapp (may create from mvn command or from eclipse env)

we can create a simple web application:(my-webapp)

mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=my-webapp

now eclipse's j2ee perspective open , import maven project as :
File => import => maven => maven existing projects => next => choose the root directory of maven project ....next.... 
Now maven project is imported.
We create folder:java under src/main

Now need to associate this project under github repository:
in J2ee perspective,  right click on project => Team => share project => choose repository from given repo-list => Finish.  Now local maven web app is associated to github reposiroty.

Any change, we done on project and try to upload in github, just go to git perspective => It shows "unstaged changes" => make it staged using drag or ++ => give some commit message => click "Commit and push" =>close
check github repository.
